# RestfulAPI-ASPNET
## Introduction

This ASP.net Web API project is meant to be an exemplary  review and a template. You can download this repo and look into the code for ideas or change and use however you need.

[.NET 6 Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) is the latest version of the popular .NET framework, providing developers with a modern, secure, and scalable platform for building powerful web applications. It includes a range of features and capabilities, such as enhanced security, improved performance, and better scalability.

The project makes use of a variety of modern technologies, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), MongoDB, and Clean Architecture. JWT is used to ensure that only authorized clients can access the data, while MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable database. Clean Architecture is used to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. Swagger for API documentation. Together, these technologies provide a secure, reliable, and maintainable platform for building web applications.

## Review

Overall, ASP.net was a complex and business oriented framework design. I enjoyed learning it the first week, but later as the project grew things got a bit complicated to keep in mind. If you build a good structure using a model, such as Clean Architecture, your job can be easier.

Injection and modular mechanism works great. It helps you separate stuff into small and simpler building blocks but as I’ve said, if you are after a simple project, this can be more than what you are looking for. Separating the project helps you change stuff later on, such as a function or a variable because it doesn't affect another building block.

For websites with business oriantation, such as e-shops, this framework is a great pick. Last of all, this is a personal review. I've tinkered with the framework and C# language for a month and this is what I encountered. Your experience may differ from me completely.
